# Route Planner Project

This project is a route planner that plots a path between two points on a map using real map data from the OpenStreetMap project. The project uses the A* search algorithm to find the optimal path and renders the path on a map using the IO2D graphics library.

## Introduction

This Route Planner project is part of the Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program. It implements a simple route planning application using the A* search algorithm, a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. The application reads OpenStreetMap data and visualizes the shortest path between two points on the map.

## Features

- Reads and processes map data from OpenStreetMap.
- Implements the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path.
- Visualizes the map and the route using the IO2D graphics library.

This repo contains the starter code for the Route Planning project.
